# week-01_LAB_SWITCH


## Create a new playground in your Xcode IDE, name it : conditionals_lab_switch
## Change the following code to use the Swich conditional instead of If-Else

 let colorBlue  = "Blue"  
 let colorRed = "Red"  
 let colorPicked = "Red"  
 
 if  colorPicked == colorRed {   
      print("Yes! this is the picked color")  
 } else if colorPicked == colorBlue   {  
      print ("Not the picked color!")  
 } else {  
      print("color picked is not known")  
 }
